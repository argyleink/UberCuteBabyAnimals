                <h3>I'm hand selecting the content now with my fiance, we only find you babies in HD. We want
                    the pictures to look as good as they can be. It's addicting to go cute baby animals hunting,
                    making this app was the opposite of torture. Expect more and more babies, and keep working and
                     living better and better.
